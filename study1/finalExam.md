(1) things that make you tougher： 让你变得更坚强的事情

Difficult times will force me to face these difficulties.

```
Difficult times will force me to face these difficulties. and I think the reason why I become stronger now is not because of one thing that makes me strong, but because of the constant setbacks and blows that make me summarize the reasons constantly, and hone my ability to resist pressure. It is the knowledge I get from books and the encouragement of others that make me gradually become strong. Some of the frustrations that I've encountered. For example, I got a bad score in the exam, people around me said harsh words to me, my parents' misunderstanding of me and the difficulties I met in work and so on. In fact, these problems often occur in my life, but these setbacks and my experience let me know that it is useless to complain and escape. Instead, I face my problems head-on. I will overcome them if I can, and wait if I can't.

(2) Things you wish you could change about yourself 你希望自己能改变的事情

```
One thing I wish I could change is to be myself. I always pay too much attention to how the people around me are doing. Whether others have learned more knowledge, whether others have made a beautiful girlfriend, whether others have a rich family environment, whether others look good, whether others are more humorous than me and so on. I'm also very concerned about what other people think of me.In fact, my feelings and thoughts only caused me more anxiety and low self-esteem. It didn't make me realize my value and it didn't make me grow. So, I want to be myself

(3) The kind of person you would fall in love with 你会爱上什么样的人

```
In fact, I would use appearance level as the first level in a relationship.I am more likely to fall in love with a beautiful girl, in my mind the beautiful girl is slim, have a big mouth, preferably similar to Angelina Jolie. Haha, this is just a kidding
In addition to beauty, I hope she is a gentle, kind, and independent thinking girl. I hate a person love to say dirty words, and do not love clean, have a variety of bad habits. It would have been better if the girl had maintained a proper sense of humor, perhaps because my standards might have been a little high. As a result, I am still single all the time.

(4) How has fashion changed in China? 时尚在中国发生了怎样的变化?

```
In fact, China has changed a lot in the past 100 years or so. From the Qing Dynasty to the present Communist Party, the concept of fashion has changed dramatically. For example, hair style, from the Qing Dynasty men to keep long braids, to the revolutionary period of short hair, and then to the popular European and American perm hair, dyed hair. Chinese women from the previous foot binding, binding the chest to the back can wear a bra, no more foot binding. From ordinary woven clothes to cheongsam to shorts. Women don't dress as conservatively as they used to. What's more, China now has a stronger tolerance for fashion. No matter you wear all kinds of strange clothes, you will not be regarded as a strange person like in China in the past

(6) Can you teach the skill you learned for your presentation? 你能传授你在演讲中所学到的技能吗?

But be careful not to just give your opinion and ignore the feelings of your audience. Here are a few tips to help you have a good presentation.

(7) Being a good sport

```
First of all, as far as I am concerned, a good exercise is one that is beneficial to the body, rather than one that costs the body. Then, a good sport should be absolutely fair and just, and there will be no gender discrimination, racial discrimination, regional discrimination and other concepts. And it would be even better if it were suitable for both young and old. Children can exercise their bodies in sports, make more friends, and avoid indulging in the virtual network world alone. Middle-aged people can get physical relaxation in this sport, the elderly can maintain physical health through this sport, as well as make their own life very rich, so that the old age of life is more meaningful. I think this kind of sport is a good sport

There are many kinds of smart. I think I am body smart. I am a left-handed, my left hand is more flexible than my right hand, I always use my left hand to use scissors, brush my teeth, play mobile phone, play table tennis, play badminton and so on. I can even write and eat with my left hand without any practice. Moreover, my left hand is stronger, so I have a higher chance of winning by arm wrestling with my left hand than my peers. I'm pretty good at table tennis. When I was in primary school, I had already won the table tennis championship of my school. Even many children are willing to serve as my apprentice, let me teach them to play table tennis. Even in primary school, I was able to meet a lot of partners, all through my playing table tennis to know, so I think I am physical intelligence

(9) Rules of gift giving in China

```
China is a nation that abides by traditional customs, so Chinese people also pay attention to gifts. Different gifts will be given on different festivals. For example, on the Dragon Boat Festival, we will give dumplings to our relatives and friends, and on the Mid-Autumn Festival, we will give moon cakes. During the Spring Festival, the elders give red envelopes to the younger generations. At the same time, it is best to send red gifts when the Spring Festival presents, so that it is more festive. When a friend celebrates his birthday, we will send a cake. Because in different festivals, the gifts given have their specific meanings. But be careful, if you give the wrong gift on some occasions, the person receiving the gift may feel upset or angry. For example, if you give a clock to someone on their birthday, in Chinese, it means to die.  This will only make the person receiving the gift angry, so in China, there are certain rules about giving gifts to others

(12) Can you give some examples of 'small talk?'

```
In fact, we can't live without small talk. Small talk relaxes us physically and mentally, releases our pressure and enables us to get to know each other better. Because small talk is essentially polite conversation about unimportant things. As a human being, it is impossible for us to remain serious and serious all the time, and to mention work or study in every word we say. If we always maintain this state, then to me, being human is no fun, like a ruthless machine. We usually talk about their own interests in the chat, talk about the joys and sorrows of life recently, when it comes to love object, referring to his ideal, and so on, these rich life meaning of words can actually add a lot of fun for our life, and into the miles of space that intervene between a man and, for me, small talk is an essential thing in life.

(13) How can you stay motivated to keep speaking English?

```
In fact, speaking good and authentic English is a very cool thing. I like watching foreign movies, such as Batman. When both Batman and the Joker speak very cool English, I imagine that I am Batman. The way I speak now is Batman or I am the Joker, and I should use the crazy tone to show that I am the Joker. Then I would go crazy watching Batman or the Joker speak English in movies, and I would imitate them to say English like (Joker pronunciation). I think this will keep me motivated to learn English for a long time
