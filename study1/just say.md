So there are a couple of things i wanted to do in this video. The first thing i'd like to do is ask you about how your english learning is going. and the second thing i'd like to do is to give all of you some encouragement. i want to help you feel positive about learning the english language. So let's start with the first one. How is your english leaning going. I'd love to know, and if you could tell me in the comments below, that will be awesome. I won't be able to respond to all the comments. but i'll make a sincere effort to respond to a lot of them on the first day.
So tell me in the comments below how things are going. Maybe even tell me about some success that you recently had. Maybe you've watched eight episodes of an English language television show. Maybe you've read an entire novel in English. Maybe you took an English test, and whether you passed by a little bit or a lot. just tell me in the comments below that you passed.
I think celebrating your successes is a way to encourage yourself. So in this video about encouragement. I think it's a great way to start. So let me known when the comments below how things are going. let me know about the things that you have felt success on.
